				I was glad that we got this assignment as we were all eager to do the things we've learnt.It was quite good experience that I had while doing this assignment.There were quite ups and downs while doing this assignment as i missed some of my classes but I did my work with the help of revision classes. Then I didn't have any problem while doing this assignment and completed my work fluently.

Then after 2 days I started it again and created my home page and portfolio page.Then, the following day I created the contact page. On the sixth day I completed my html and then i made the designs. After that I started doing it in the mobile then it took 4 days from that day to complete the work.
